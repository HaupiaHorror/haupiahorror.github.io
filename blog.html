					        As Via started finishing her graphics models along with their animations, the Dev team had a lot to
					        work with in terms of setting up the levels. Seen on left is the Centipede in the Game Environment
					        along with its Animation Controller. The past week we continued to finish up these "mini-boss"
					        levels and now we're starting to get a feel for the flow and atmosphere of the game
					        <br>
					        We also just finished our mid-way progress presentation. At the end we got some fresh feedback about
					        some of our visuals and gameplay, and we are taking it all into consideration for future
					        development. Our team also got hit with a reality check: We only have 3 more weeks of Dev time! I
					        have faith that our team will be able to pull off a great game.

                            On the animation side of the team, progress was made in finishing the modeling and animations of the bug characters.
                            Each bug was modeled, rigged, and textured in Maya and imported into Unity. They also have loopable idle, walking, and
                            attack keyframe animations for the programmers to use. Other assets including a flyswatter and honey bomb were also made
                            and the other's are in progress. Along with 3D assets, a few 2D sprite assets are also to be made and used for our
                            game's UI.

                            Now that we have an environment, we've begun to code the movement for both the player as well as the various bugs in the game.
                            The picture on the left shows an early rough prototype of the swarming and surrounding bug behavior we are implementing for some of the smaller bugs in the game.
                            We also started implementing player movement, player controls for throwing items and the item inventory.  
                            <br>
                            Most of the main models are complete and Visual Development continues with rigging the larger bugs.

					        Over Spring Break, Team Haupia Horror continued to work hard on our game. Katrina worked on further
					        developing the main scene (picture left). This will help us grasp the feel for the game as well as
					        - quite literally - set the stage for further development. Kameron worked on development of Ai for
					        the bugs in the game. This process should hopefully get us into the specifics of game mechanics so
					        we can flush out all we need to. Via continues to work on developing our visual assets, as well as
					        finalizing textures and materials for existing assets.

						        This past week our team decided to narrow down our idea and work on refining one level (Bug Floor).
						        It was also the week to start visual development through reference collection and creature designing
						        in which one solidified design was modeled, textured, and rigged in Maya. This gave us a better
						        understanding of the time it takes for a character asset to be fleshed out in order to determine
						        how many more we'd like to add. For the next few days vis dev will continue with completing designs
						        for at least one more bug monster and environment design.

                            We had our first team meeting to brainstorm game ideas.  We came up with a lot of cool ideas for art style, game play, concept, and more. 
                            We settled on a horror theme and a 3D world.  We are keeping an open mind about everything else so we can keep brainstorming throughout the week.
