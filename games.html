            Bugs. Bugs! BUGS! Entomophobia is a fast paced horror game set in an old abandoned house filled with bugs.
            Armed only with household items like a flyswatter and bug spray, you must navigate through the maze like
            hallways and defeat the bugs before they eat you! Be careful... some of them are monstrous!

            We used Trello to help manage all the tasks in our project. Cards were created in the <b>Backlog</b> as we
            thought of things that needed to be done in the game.
            From there they were assigned to a team member (or two) and moved to <b>In Progress</b> as the team member
            started working on them.
            This gave us an easy list of things to discuss at weekly meetings. Once an item was complete it was moved to
            the
            <b>Completed</b> column and if applicable, <b>Added to Game</b> once added to the working version of the
            Main
            Scene.
            <br>
            We also used it to house our weekly meeting agenda and various resources such as links and notes from our
            professor. It made it really easy to stay organized with everything in one place!
